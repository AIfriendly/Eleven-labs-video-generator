# Cross-Functional Architecture Decisions

## Joint Recommendations:

**1. Core Architecture: Hexagonal with Pipeline Core**
- Product: Provides flexibility to adapt to market needs
- Engineer: Enables testability and maintainability
- Designer: Allows for clean, predictable user experience

**2. API Integration Strategy: Resilient Orchestration**
- Product: Must handle API failures gracefully to maintain user trust
- Engineer: Requires queue management and retry logic
- Designer: Users need clear feedback during API issues

**3. User Interface: Guided Terminal Experience**
- Product: Must be accessible yet powerful enough for professional use
- Engineer: Should be straightforward to implement and maintain
- Designer: Needs to guide users through complex process simply

**4. Monitoring & Feedback: Real-time and Transparent**
- Product: Cost transparency is a key differentiator
- Engineer: Requires integration into processing pipeline
- Designer: Users need actionable information during processing
